// What is OOP? List of OOP Concepts.
// =>OOP stands for Object oriented Programming.
// =>OOP concepts are use for solving the real life problems.
// =>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
//  - OOP is faster and easier to execute
//  -OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
//  -OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
//  -OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
//  =>There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.
//   -Class:-The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. 
//    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
//    which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

//   -Objects:-An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class.
//    When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
//   -Encapsulation:-In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit. 
//    In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
//    Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section,
//    sales section, etc.
//   -Abstraction:-Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. 
//    Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only
//    essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. Consider a real-life
//    example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying 
//    brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know
//    about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of an accelerator, brakes, etc. in the car. This is what abstraction is.
//   -Polymorphism:-The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message
//    to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father,
//    a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. 
//   -Inheritance:-The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
//    Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
